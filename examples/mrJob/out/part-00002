Your role will add value to the business both by applying methods from the ML/AI literature to specific clinical development projects, working alongside project statisticians and the wider data science community in GSK, as well as embedding those methods within the wider Statistics & Programming community.\n<br/><br/>\nThe successful candidates will have strong technical abilities, but also a demonstrated track record in delivering concrete solutions within specified timelines. We have two positions available, suitable for candidates at both early and later stages of their careers.\n<br/><br/>\n<strong>SDS projects include:</strong>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Development and integration of ML algorithms into GSK processes or data pipelines</li>\n<li>Provision of data science training courses</li>\n<li>Creation of bespoke applications for both technical and non-technical users</li>\n</ul>\n\nApplied experience of working with Machine Learning algorithms is essential to the role. This includes the implementation of these algorithms within an engineered workflow. Given the position of SDS within Clinical Statistics, a strong knowledge of statistics, ideally supported by at least a masters-level qualification is highly desirable. At a minimum you must be comfortable discussing the assumptions, constraints and workings of both traditional statistical methods and machine learning algorithms with SDS colleagues.\n<br/><br/>\nCommunication is a highly important skill in this role. As well as being able to discuss ML statistics / algorithms at a technical level, at times you will be required to outline the various methodologies to non-statistical colleagues. This will likely include the use of suitable visualisations using R, python or Javascript.\n<br/><br/>\nAt a technical level you will work with both internal and external data sources. This includes GSK\u2019s R&D Information Platform, RDIP. RDIP is based upon Hadoop infrastructure (HDFS) with a growing number of tools available with which to explore the data (MapReduce, Impala, Hive, Pig, Spark, python, R, \u2026). First and foremost, this is an analytical role and you must therefore be extremely competent in R and/or python. Although it is not essential to have worked with all of the technologies in GSK\u2019s big data stack, experience with SQL and/or noSQL is important. A good working knowledge of the aforementioned big data technologies is highly beneficial. You should also be have experience in researching and extracting external sources of information to compliment the internal sources.\n<br/><br/>\nWhen applying for this role, please use the \u2018cover letter\u2019 of the online application or your CV to describe how you meet the competencies for this role, as outlined in the job requirements above.
