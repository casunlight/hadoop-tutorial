We ingest a staggering amount of data and wish to discover new ways to use that data to improve the customer experience of Apple Maps.\nData Engineering team collaborates with the data science team to productize and scale models that evaluate quality of maps data, and identify specific issues. \nn this role, you would enjoy working in a diverse technical team, where everyone learns from each other's unrivaled skills and knowledge. \nYour bias for action means you thrive in an environment where you can get things done. We encourage and respect critical thinking. Challenge yourself, challenge the data, and challenge us.\nYou possess strong technical skills to turn large scale data into actionable insights. You also have the ability to think about the big picture and connect the dots to evaluate how the insights impact Apples ecosystem.\nA track record of crafting, implementing and delivering scalable, performant data pipelines and data services.\nExtensive experience in building solutions that scale out or scale up. \nYour multithreading experience and long range viewpoint on distributed systems mean you recognize when something is technically feasible, but a bad idea in the real world.\nStrong design and architecture background. You know which architecture, technology, and schema can make or break the success of a system.\nStrong analytical skills and experience with machine learning algorithms\nYou rigorously demonstrate on the best coding practices, while moving flexibly among technologies and programming languages.\nYou will join our Maps Data Evaluation team. We\u2019re responsible for demonstrating statistical models and machine learning to identify hard-to-detect issues in Maps data. \nYou will develop batch and real-time data storage/management architectures.\nYou will design and implement workflows for data science to apply statistical testing on massive data.\n You will work multi-functionally to drive platform architecture and design, analyzing data, and producing insights.\nYou will handle with data scientists to facilitate experimentation/prototyping.\nYou will scale and integrate the most effective models into critical systems that gate releases and protect our customer experience.\nWe're looking for a talented and passionate person to join this amazing team, if you feel this is you, we'd love to hear from you.\n\n\",\"additionalRequirements\":\"<br></br>PhD or Master\u2019s in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics,<br></br>", "jobLocation": {"geo": {"longitude": "-121.9542", "@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "37.3542"}, "@type": "Place", "address": {"addressCountry": {"name": "US", "@type": "Country"}, "addressLocality": "Santa Clara", "addressRegion": "CA", "@type": "PostalAddress"}}, "@context": "http://schema.org", "datePosted": "2018-09-07", "validThrough": "2018-10-07", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "occupationalCategory": ["15-1132.00", "Software Developers, Applications"], "salaryCurrency": "USD", "empId": 1138, "hiringOrganization": {"sameAs": "www.apple.com", "@type": "Organization", "name": "Apple"}, "@type": "JobPosting", "jobId": 2888621584, "estimatedSalary": {"currency": "USD", "value": {"minValue": "193000", "@type": "QuantitativeValue", "maxValue": "218000", "unitText": "YEAR"}, "@type": "MonetaryAmount"}, "title": "Senior Software/Data Engineer", "industry": "Information Technology"}
